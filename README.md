# My custom layer for Allen Webster's 4coder editor 

If you don't know what 4coder is, [you should try it out](http://4coder.net) and if you want to learn more about the editor or custom layer visit the [4coder Discord](https://discord.gg/NQEdQSU)

Each file (for the most part) can be added individually as an .h file with instructions on usage and installation in the file itself.

If you want to install the code as a whole, add this folder to {4coder Root}/custom/{this folder} 
and run the build.bat script within a vcvars environment (but if you're here I'm sure you already know this)
