# My custom layer for Allen Webster's 4coder editor 

If you don't know what 4coder is, [you should try it out](http://4coder.net) and if you want to learn more about the editor or custom layer visit the [4coder Discord](https://discord.gg/NQEdQSU)

Each file (for the most part) can be added individually as an .h file with instructions on usage and installation in the file itself.
